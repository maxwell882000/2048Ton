# React TypeScript Vite App - Mini Telegram Coin Tapper

## Overview

This project is a **Mini Telegram App** built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It simulates a 2047 game for Telegram users, with the possibility to add **referrals** and a **referrer** system. Users can play 2048 to gain coins, with the option to refer others to the game, earning rewards for both the referrer and the referee.
